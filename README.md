### What's this about

I got tired of doing the same boring dev tasks over and over. Writing commit messages, creating READMEs, making OG images. So I started building CLI tools that do it for me.

They're all open source, free, and you don't need to install anything. Just `npx` and go.

### Stuff I've shipped

```bash
npx ai-og-image "Your Title"    # makes OG images from a prompt
npx ai-readme-gen                # writes your README by reading your code
npx ai-commit                    # looks at your diff, writes the commit
npx ai-env-gen                   # scans your code, builds the .env
npx ai-alt-text                  # generates alt text for your images
npx ai-pdf-builder ai whitepaper "topic"  # spits out a full PDF
```

More on the way. I try to ship one a week.

### Writing

I write about the stuff I'm building and things I'm figuring out along the way.

- [LXGIC on Substack](https://lxgicstudios.substack.com) – AI tools, dev workflows, building in public
- [Whale Factor](https://whalefactor.substack.com) – crypto and macro

### Right now

- Shipping new CLI tools every week
- Growing [@LXGIC-Studios](https://github.com/LXGIC-Studios) as an open source org
- Writing about what's working and what isn't
